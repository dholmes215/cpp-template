Template for David's C++ projects.

To build this project you will need:

* Presently only Linux is supported
* A C++17 compiler (g++ or clang++)
* CMake 3.17 or later.  You could use an older version, but you'll need to modify your CMakeLists.txt accordingly.  "Modern CMake" has recommendations on where to get CMake here: <https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/intro/installing.html>
